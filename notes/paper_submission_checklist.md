# During writing tasks to complete
- [ ] Write the outline of how you want your paper organized & have someone edit it harshly
	- include experiments, what you hope to have for each figure, and a short abstract
- [ ] Make sure the first sentence of the abstract is really strong and basically conveys the message/main problem of the paper
- [ ] Verify who will be an author on the paper - any technical contacts who should be included?



# Perform these checks on the final version of the paper before uploading for review

## PDF
- [ ] Is the authors section on the first page appropriately blinded?
- [ ] Do any author identifiers appear in the text? emails, urls, etc.
- [ ] Does the paper meet the formatting guidelines?
- [ ] Does the main content of the paper meet the page number restriction?
- [ ] Do the references meet any length restrictions? 
- [ ] Are all calls to \cite or \ref correctly processed? Make sure there are no "as seen in Figure ??" or "as John Doe et al. [??] showed" in the text
- [ ] Is the math formatted appropriately? No formulas running outside of their boxes, text too small to see, unnumbered equations, etc.
- [ ] Double check the margins, ensure nothing bleeds over into them. 
- [ ] Have you used the correct author kit if provided? Make sure its the right one for the current year! 
- [ ] Are all figures and tables referenced somewhere in the text? 
- [ ] Are all figures/tables readable in the final rendering of the pdf? Are they clean?
- [ ] Was the 'review' type formatting applied, or the 'camera-ready' type? This can often be things like line numbers, etc.


## Supplemental PDF
- [ ] Do any author identifiers appear anywhere in the supplemental text?

## Other supplemental material
- [ ] Do any author identifiers appear anywhere in the supplemental material? Check READMEs, code files (via grep/fuzzy finders), video files, datasets (for binary data formats, ensure that names/hostnames/emails don't appear anywhere in the metadata)
- [ ] If required, do you have a readme explaining what each file in the supplemental is, or are files described in a supplemental PDF?

# Checks for camera-ready version
- [ ] Are all of the needed author names on the paper?
